I have used basic HTML elements to create a Recipe website. 

I have used:
    anchor links which direct the user to the main page.
    img element showing the image of the dish, I adjusted height-width and added alt text to img.
    h1 for main heading, h3 for sub-headings.
    unordered and ordered lists for ingredients and steps respectively.
    p elements, inside which I added strong element to separate the ingredient from the text and get the attention of visually imparied people to the ingredient, as well as em element.
